"""
Log parsing: read stdin and compute metrics.

Prints after every 10 lines read and at EOF (and on CTRL+C):
- Total file size: sum of the last field when it's an int
- Counts of status codes among {200, 301, 400, 401, 403, 404, 405, 500}

Parsing is intentionally tolerant: it tries to read the last two
whitespace-separated tokens as <status> <size>. If those parse,
theyâ€™re counted; otherwise the line is ignored for that metric.
